Key Elements for a Winning Resume:
ATS Optimization: Use keywords from the job description and a simple, ATS-friendly layout.

Essential Sections:

Contact Information: Full name, phone, email, LinkedIn, GitHub (if applicable).
Skills: Highlight technical skills at the top; avoid skill ratings.
Work Experience: Describe each role using action verbs, quantified achievements, and measurable impact. Use the format "Accomplished X by doing Y, resulting in Z."
Education: Include degrees, schools, and relevant coursework if recent; GPA is optional.
Projects: Add impactful projects with brief descriptions and your contributions.
Awards/Certifications: Add only relevant and valuable recognitions.
Concise and Relevant:

One page for less experience; 1.5 pages for over five years.
Only include information relevant to the job; leave out skills like MS Word if they donâ€™t add value.
Professional Formatting:

Use clean design, readable fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman), and 10-12 pt font size.
Bullet points instead of paragraphs; no sentence over three lines.
Quantify Achievements:

Emphasize impact with data and results (e.g., reduced cost by 20%).
Customization:

Tailor each section to align with the specific role requirements.
Proofreading:

Eliminate typos, grammatical errors, and inconsistencies.
